<br>

As a result of our taking action towards re-branding with our newest references and color palette, I designed and built our agency website from scratch using Next.js, Tailwindcss, and Framer-Motion. It's mostly a single-page application with a blog section and an admin panel. It's optimized for Google search with the best SEO practices combined with localization.

<br>

As a developer who doesn't feel the same comfort while coding front compared to the backend or server-side systems, I can comfortably say making this website broke the ice for me. It also taught me a lot about SEO and optimizing a web app to take it from the development level to the production level.
