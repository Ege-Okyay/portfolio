This is a project that I did to show my knowledge of **Python, sockets and computer vision using Opencv**. Adding these new technologies to the **daily life** is one of my favorite ways to use my skills and this project is one of them!

I used **Pygame** to make the game then coded a **hand tracking module using Google's Mediapipe library**. After that, I send the x coordinates of the index finger to the game using **socket communications**. Then I **modify those coordinates** to fit the game's and move the player accordingly.
