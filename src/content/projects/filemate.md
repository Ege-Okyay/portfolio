For me, learning Go has been an incredible experience. Coding a simple CRUD API was the first step in the process. I've been rebuilding my open-source file-sharing platform for some time now. I'm transforming it into a CLI similar to Git. Go is used to code the entire project, including the API. While developing the API has taught me a lot, building the CLI system from the ground up has taught me even more. I've currently completed developing the API. As for the CLI, I've completed building the fundamentals, which include a command that sends GET requests, version and help commands, and command processing. Anyone learning a new programming language should consider building a CLI system ðŸ™‚.
