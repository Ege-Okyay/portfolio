Wrote a data scraping library that scrapes data from **multiple APIs + with web scraping**. Used the network tab on the Chrome inspect panel to see the **API requests** then **imitated them in Postman** and **observed the headers and parameters**, wrote a **custom function that makes it easier to send custom cURL requests**. Implemented **caching** to make the functions that used web scraping instead of API. In the end, I returned all data in a **JSON format**. My colleague used the library in a **web app and visualized the data using graphs**.
