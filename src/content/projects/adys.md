Imagine a world where during a crisis, getting help is just a click away. That's the vision behind my latest project. In addition to developing a user-friendly system that streamlines communication and assistance during natural disasters, I wrote a report that goes into great detail.

My primary goal with this project is to develop a stand-alone system that will enable easy location detection, assistance dispatch, and general communication to make it easier between two groups.

I've designed the user interfaces, coded the mobile application using Flutter, created an API using Express.js as well, and made a website that reads real-time data from the API using React.js.
