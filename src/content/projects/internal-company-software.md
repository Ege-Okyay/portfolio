I took on the role of **project manager** and **lead developer** of internal software that is **going to be used daily in the company**. Mainly used **Python with Flask** for the full stack, **gave the other 7 people in my team what to do**, and **kept track of them**. This was one of the most useful projects that I have worked on and also going to help me a ton while building my **managing skills**.
