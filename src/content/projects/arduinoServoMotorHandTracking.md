I created a project that enables hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Python. I was able to communicate with an Arduino-based servo motor by using the PyFirmata module. I created this project to show how computer vision and hardware control can work together, offering an interactive interface for manipulating the Servo motor using hand gestures.

Whole project demonstrates the potential of hand-controlled hardware systems and gain valuable experience in the fields of computer vision, hardware integration, and human-computer interaction.
